 📚 Blockchain Library

*Blockchain Library* is a decentralized publishing ecosystem designed to empower creators, preserve truth, and build a future of open collaboration. Our flagship release, the *Genesis Badge DApp*, allows early supporters to mint a soulbound badge and leave their mark on-chain as contributors to a movement built "By the People, For the People."
